# CptS 321: Object-Oriented Software Principles
## Course description: 
Object-Oriented Programming for flexibility, efficiency, and maintainability; logic and UI decoupling; complexity analysis, data structures, and algorithms for industry-quality software.
## Overview and Course Goals: 
This course teaches students how to write flexible, efficient, and maintainable software using object-oriented programming features. Students will learn about designing applications with a graphical user interface and how to decouple UI and logic into separately maintainable and extensible modules. They will also learn how to implement several practical features found in modern software and how to use design patterns effectively in order to minimize the amount of code written and concurrently maximize software flexibility.
## Course Topics:
  * Graphical user interface design
  * Decoupling of software components
  * Data structures for modern software features
  * Design patterns for modern software features
## Learning Outcomes & Evaluation:
#### Students that successfully complete the course will be able to:
  1. Describe and apply the fundamental concepts of the C# programming language including the typing system, inheritance and polymorphism rules, and reflection.
  2. Describe how the event-driven model works for desktop applications and apply this knowledge to build software with graphical user interfaces.
  3. Describe and implement object-oriented design patterns and strategies that allow for updates to code that do not disrupt any other existing application components.
  4. Explain and implement expression tree data structures for evaluating arithmetic expressions.
  5. Build applications piece-by-piece, building on previous foundations without making the code difficult to manage.
